You are helping to build a classification system for a business related to "{business}". 

Generate 5 common FAQ-style domains that represent typical questions users ask. Each domain should be:
- short (just a phrase, not a full sentence),
- semantically meaningful,
- useful for classification,
- and compatible with a model like facebook/bart-large-mnli.

Return only the domain list, each item on a new line, with no additional explanation.

Format your output like this:
  - Domain 1
  - Domain 2
  - Domain 3

Now generate for: "{business}"
