Given a business type: "{business}", generate 5 common FAQ-style domains representing general customer concerns.

Each domain must:
- be short, 2–4 words (not full sentences),
- be a general category or topic of concern,
- be semantically meaningful and specific enough for classification,
- be compatible with models like facebook/bart-large-mnli,
- avoid vague or overly broad terms.

For each domain, provide 3 example **answers** a customer service agent might give in response to typical questions **within** that domain.

Avoid including any customer questions. Write only the agent’s responses. Keep responses brief, helpful, and natural.

Format your output **exactly** like this:

- domain name (lowercase, no punctuation):
  - answer 1
  - answer 2
  - answer 3

Only return the list. Do not include explanations, questions, or introductory text.
